         When I was born, I went nameless for hours. No one knew what to name me. Out of the blue, my grandma suggested "Erin Taylor" because she thought it sounded famous. My dad loved it! But not for the famous reason. He was like "That's perfect! E.T. as in E.T Phone home!" So basically, I'm named after an <strong>alien.</strong> <br>

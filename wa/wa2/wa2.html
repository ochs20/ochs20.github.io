    <p>I am currently a <em>senior</em> at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am studying Business, specifically marketing, and getting a minor in Creative Technology and Design. My favorite music artists are Noah Kahan, <b>Taylor Swift</b>, Harry Styles, and Zach Bryan.</p>
    <h4> My <u>goal</u> this semester is to improve my coding skills.</h4>
    <p>Specifically, I want to be able to code a very basic personal website so I can put it on my resume. <em>It doesnt have to be pretty, it just needs to work!</em></p>
